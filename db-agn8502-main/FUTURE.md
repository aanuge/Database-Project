# Reactions
### I would create a new table for  each community containing the reaction, who sent the reaction, and the id of the message that it was reacted to
### I would only need to provide a react API in order to do this
### I do not believe I would have to change my existing API's

# Threaded conversations
### I would create a new table for each community that would represent conversation threads. They would contain the content of whatever message they are sending in the thread, the user who sent it, and the id of the original message
### The only API I would need to provide is one to send a thread message
### I would not need to change any existing API's
