# Database-Project
Delivered an API as a set of Python methods that interact with a relational database via SQL to model a chat system and complete various tasks.

Iteration 1: Focused mainly on establishing the initial schema and setting up test data. Implemented SQL for retrieving data.

Iteration 2: Built an API using REST so that the database could be interacted with from a browser. Implemented functions for listing users, listing communities and channels, listing messages in a particular channel, and searching for messages.
